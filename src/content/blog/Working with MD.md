# Basics

Notion is made out of `blocks` of content

This line, *now marked in purple*, is a block 

But **you can** use **`inline` styling as ~~well~~**, i.e. style inside a `text element`. 

Create blocks by pressing the `/` key, or use the *plus icon* on the left of each block, while hovering

The hover *plus icon*

You can easily create grids like the one you're now viewing by dragging and dropping `blocks` of content

Grids stack differently in web then mobile. This is how:

> **Keep in mind â†’** Everything in Notion is changeable, movable and editable, reversible and indestructible. So don't be afraid to explore!

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables          | Are             | Cool  | and      | are       | Pretty      |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----- |---       | ---       | ---         |
| col 3 is        | right-aligned   | $1600 | *Still*  | `renders` | nice  |
| col 2 is        | centered        |   $12 | 1        | 2         | 3           |
| zebra stripes   | are neat        |    $1 | 100      | 2000      | 9349        |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty      |
| ---      | ---       | ---         |
| *Still*  | `renders` | **nicely**  |
| 1        | 2         | 3           |
